            <h3>A lil bit about myself UWU</h3>
            <p>I am a 21 years old boy who is currently living in Vietnam, but I do plan
                to move to the US for my loving boyfriend~. I am currently majoring at computer science although
                I do study things like psychology and history alongside with it. My favorite food is
                 probably fried chickens and my favorite drink is macha milk tea. My favorite clothing are kawaii dresses and skirts, I usually prefer not wearing pants at all!
