            <p>@PunishedBowie came to my life at December 24th, 2020 and he forever changed my life</p>
            <p>Ever since I met him, I was given an important goal in my life to keep fighting for myself and for him
                , because my happiness and fortune bring him happiness. He made my life as a boy bearable for me and I want to embrace him and protect him with all I have.
            </p>
            <p>While I still refer to him as my boyfriend, to me he isn't just a boyfriend, he is the love of my life that enriched me and I shall protect him with all that I have.</p>
            <p>He is a responsible and loving gentleman that I will forever appreciate God for bringing us together, even if our distance is an issue, it is an issue I'm willing to fight against with all my power and resources. For that I love and appreciate him.</p>
